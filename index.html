<h1>Volleyball!</h1>
  <h2>What is volleyball?</h2>
<p>Volleyball is a sport that is played all around the world, although it isn't as famous as football/soccer but it's just as fun (maybe even more)! Volleyball is a sport that requires you to have working hands and a good mind set. It might not be as great as I make it out to be - when you first start playing - but trust me, once you get the hang of it and when all of your shots are accurate of course - it'll be <strong>SO</strong> fun! Volleyball is a sport conissting of two teams, usually six on each side of the net, to play the sport correctly, you have to hit/bat the volleyball over a high net with your hands (there are three different types of shots, disregarding the serve, to get the ball over the net), the objective of the sport is to make the ball touch the opponents'side of the court.</p>

  <h2>Rules and How to Play!</h2>
  <p>There are several rules in volleyball and I'll be telling you the 10 most popular rules in said sport!
  <h3>The Most Common 10 Rules in Volleyball!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> The maximum numbers of hits a team has is three
      <li> You can't touch the ball twice in succession, someone has to touch before you touch it once more (a block is not considered a hit)
        <li> A ball hitting a boundary line is in
          <li> If you win the point, the person standing in the front right porition moves backwards and becomes the new server (the entire team moves clockwise as well)
            <li> If your team is serving and you win the point you continue serving until you have done 5 successful serves, though if you lose the point on any of the serves - the ball goes to the other team
              <li> If you physically touch the net during a rally, the other team automatically gains the point
                <li> There must be six players playing
                  <li> If the ball goes out of bounds or doesn't make it over the net the other team wins the point
                    <li> You can't do illegal hits (carrying or any sort of throwing the volleyball)
                      <li> The serve must be done from behind the end line until after contact
  </ol>

  <h2>Positions:</h2>
  <p> There are 6 different positions in volleyball, each have their own responsibilities and you'll find out which suits you best if you have a go at all of them. Setter and/or outside hitter are the hardest positions to play, setter mainly because you have to have <em>perfect</em> sets and because you're the supporter, strategist and attacker/decoy of the team!
  <ul>
    <li> Setter
      <li> Right side hitter
        <li> Middle Blocker
          <li> Opposite
            <li> Outside hitter
              <li> MB/Libero
