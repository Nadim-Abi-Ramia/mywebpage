<h2><u>What is Volleyball?</u></h2>
<p> Volleyball is a sport that is played all over the world, and while it isn't as well-known as football or soccer, it is just as entertaining (if not more so)! Volleyball is a sport that demands both strong hands and a positive mindset. It might not be as much fun as I make it out to be when you first start playing, but trust me, once you get the hang of it and when your shots are all accurate, it'll be <strong>A LOT</strong> of fun! Volleyball is a sport in which two teams compete against each other, with six players on each side of the net. To play the game correctly, you must hit/bat the volleyball over a high net with your hands (there are three different types of shots to get the ball over the net, excluding the serve). The goal of the game is to make the ball touch the opponents' side of the court.

  <h2><u>Rules and How to Play</u></h2>
    <img src="https://www.rookieroad.com/img/volleyball/the-top-10-rules-of-indoor-volleyball.png" alt="An animated picture of a volleyball court with two people playing against each other and a coach shouting what to do"/> 
  <p>There are several rules in volleyball and I'll be telling you the 10 most popular rules in it!
  <h3><u>The Most Common 10 Rules in Volleyball!</u></h3>
  <ol>
    <li> The maximum numbers of hits a team has is three
      <li> You can't touch the ball twice in succession, someone has to touch before you touch it once more (a block is not considered a hit)
        <li> A ball hitting a boundary line is in
          <li> If you win the point, the person standing in the front right position moves backwards and becomes the new server (the entire team moves clockwise as well)
            <li> If your team is serving and you win the point you continue serving until you have done 5 successful serves, though if you lose the point on any of the serves - the ball goes to the other team
              <li> If you physically touch the net during a rally, the other team automatically gains the point
                <li> There must be six players playing
                  <li> If the ball goes out of bounds or doesn't make it over the net the other team wins the point
                    <li> You can't do illegal hits (carrying or any sort of throwing the volleyball)
                      <li> The serve must be done from behind the end line until after contact
  </ol>
  </p>
  
  <h2><u>Positions:</u></h2>
  <p> There are 4 different positions in volleyball, each have their own responsibilities and you'll find out which suits you best if you have a go at all of them. There isn't really a hardest or an easiest position in volleyball as they all have different responsibilities and techniques per se, the hardest positions to play, if you keep practicing your position, you'll be <em>perfect</em> at it - you may think that you don't need to practice hitting a ball around but if your shots aren't accurate and if you don't put enough effort into your play, you'll be letting your whole team down!
  <ul>
    <li> Setter
      <li> Power Hitter
        <li> Middle Hitter
          <li> Libero
  </ul>
  </p>

<h2><u>Who Invented Volleyball?</u></h2>
<p> William G. Morgan, the physical director of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts, invented volleyball in 1895. It was developed as an indoor sport for businesspeople who considered basketball to be too strenuous.
</p>

<h2><u>Facts:</u></h2>
<p><ol>
  <li> Players used the soft inside bladder of basketballs to play before the volleyball was created
    <li> The first <u>official volleyball</u> game was played at Springfield College on July 7th
      <li> Spiking was originated in 1916
        <li> Volleyball became more popular in the years between 1940 and 1950
          <li> The first volleyball was made by <strong>spalding</strong> 
            <li> Volleyball was considered a competing sport in the Olympic Games in 1964 (Tokyo)
</ol></p>

<h2><u>Different Variants of Volleyball</u></h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> International volleyball - International volleyball is the version of volleyball that I spent most of my time covering. As we all know, each team has six players, and each side can only have three hits before it must be hit over the net. Every rally results in a point. If teams are tied at two games apiece in a five-game set, each game is played to 25 points, with the decisive, final game played to 15 points.
    <li> Beach volleyball - Beach volleyball's striking regulations are similar to those of international volleyball. However, instead of six players, there are only two on the court at any given time. It counts as a hit if a player blocks the ball at the net (unlike indoor volleyball). The court is smaller, and beach volleyball is played outside, as the name implies. Indoor beach volleyball courts with sand-covered floors to resemble a genuine beach are available at some institutions.      <li> Wallyball - Wallyball is a fast-paced version of volleyball played on a racquetball court. Players may carom the ball off the side wall when playing it into an opponent’s court, adding a new dimension to traditional indoor volleyball. However, if someone hits the ball onto the ceiling, back wall, or both side walls without it touching an opponent, the ball is considered out of bounds. 
      <li> Bossaball - In the world of volleyball, bossaball is a relatively new addition. Bossaball is a sport that combines volleyball, soccer, and gymnastics. It was invented in Spain in 2005. The game is played on a trampoline-filled inflatable court. The ball can be hit or kicked over the net by players (kicking a volleyball is against the rules in international play).          
        <li> Jokgu - This is a popular sport in South Korea, jokgu is a blend of tennis, soccer, and volleyball. There are up to four players per side in this variation of volleyball, but they can only use their feet to play the ball. Jokgu is traditionally played on a grass court, but it can also be played indoors or on the beach. The net is only a few feet above the ground, about the same height as a tennis net. Players can bounce the ball once before kicking it over the goal with a strong kick.</ul>
