Volleyball is a sport conissting of two teams, usually six on each side of the net, to play the sport correctly, you have to hit/bat the volleyball over a high net with your hands (there are three different types of shots, disregarding the serve, to get the ball over the net), the objective of the sport is to make the ball touch the opponents'side of the court.</p>
