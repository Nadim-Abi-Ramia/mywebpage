  <h2><u>What is Volleyball?</u></h2>
<p>Volleyball is a sport that is played all around the world, although it isn't as famous as football/soccer it's just as fun (maybe even more)! Volleyball is a sport that requires you to have working hands and a good mind set. It might not be as great as I make it out to be - when you first start playing - but trust me, once you get the hang of it and when all of your shots are accurate of course - it'll be <strong>SO</strong> fun! Volleyball is a sport consisting of two teams, usually six on each side of the net, to play the sport correctly, you have to hit/bat the volleyball over a high net with your hands (there are three different types of shots, disregarding the serve, to get the ball over the net), the objective of the sport is to make the ball touch the opponents' side of the court.</p>

  <h2><u>Rules and How to Play</u></h2>
  <p>There are several rules in volleyball and I'll be telling you the 10 most popular rules in it!
  <h3><u>The Most Common 10 Rules in Volleyball!</u></h3>
  <ol>
    <li> The maximum numbers of hits a team has is three
      <li> You can't touch the ball twice in succession, someone has to touch before you touch it once more (a block is not considered a hit)
        <li> A ball hitting a boundary line is in
          <li> If you win the point, the person standing in the front right position moves backwards and becomes the new server (the entire team moves clockwise as well)
            <li> If your team is serving and you win the point you continue serving until you have done 5 successful serves, though if you lose the point on any of the serves - the ball goes to the other team
              <li> If you physically touch the net during a rally, the other team automatically gains the point
                <li> There must be six players playing
                  <li> If the ball goes out of bounds or doesn't make it over the net the other team wins the point
                    <li> You can't do illegal hits (carrying or any sort of throwing the volleyball)
                      <li> The serve must be done from behind the end line until after contact
  </ol>
  </p>
  
  <h2><u>Positions:</u></h2>
  <p> There are 4 different positions in volleyball, each have their own responsibilities and you'll find out which suits you best if you have a go at all of them. There isn't really a hardest or an easiest position in volleyball as they all have different responsibilities and techniques per se, the hardest positions to play, if you keep practicing your position, you'll be <em>perfect</em> at it - you may think that you don't need to practice hitting a ball around but if your shots aren't accurate and if you don't put enough effort into your play, you'll be letting your whole team down!

<h2><u>Different Variants of Volleyball</u></h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> International volleyball - International volleyball is the version you see at Rocky Mount Event Center. Each team has six players, and teams have a maximum of three hits on one side before they must hit it over the net. Points are scored on every rally. Each game is to 25 points with the deciding, final game going to 15 points if teams are tied at two games apiece in a five-game set.
    <li> Beach volleyball - Beach volleyball has similar rules for hitting as international volleyball. However, there are only two players on the court at once instead of six. If a player blocks the ball at the net, that counts as a hit (unlike indoor volleyball). The size of the court is smaller, and beach volleyball (as the name implies) is played outdoors. Although some facilities have indoor beach volleyball courts in which the floor is covered in sand to simulate a real beach. 
      <li> Wallyball - Wallyball is a fast-paced version of volleyball played on a racquetball court. Players may carom the ball off the side wall when playing it into an opponent’s court, adding a new dimension to traditional indoor volleyball. However, if someone hits the ball onto the ceiling, back wall, or both side walls without it touching an opponent, the ball is considered out of bounds. Rocky Mount Event Center could use room dividers to make a wallyball court.
        <li> Bossaball - Bossaball is a relatively new addition to the world of volleyball. Created in Spain in 2005, bossaball combines volleyball, soccer, and gymnastics. The game is played on an inflatable court with trampolines. Players may hit or even kick the ball over the net (kicking a volleyball is against the rules in international play).
          <li> Jokgu - Jokgu is a combination of tennis, soccer, and volleyball, and it’s a very popular sport in South Korea. This version of volleyball has up to four players per side, but they can only play the ball with their feet. Jokgu is played on a grass court, traditionally, but you can play indoors and on a beach. The net is just a few feet off the ground, barely higher than a tennis net. Players can let the ball bounce once before returning it over the net with a powerful kick.
