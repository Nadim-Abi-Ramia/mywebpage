<h1>Volleyball!</h1>
  <h2>What is volleyball?</h2>
<p>Volleyball is a sport that is played all around the world, although it isn't as famous as football/soccer but it's just as fun (maybe even more)! Volleyball is a sport that requires you to have working hands and a good mind set. It might not be as great as I make it out to be - when you first start playing - but trust me, once you get the hang of it and when all of your shots are accurate of course - it'll be <strong>SO</strong> fun! Volleyball is a sport conissting of two teams, usually six on each side of the net, to play the sport correctly, you have to hit/bat the volleyball over a high net with your hands (there are three different types of shots, disregarding the serve, to get the ball over the net), the objective of the sport is to make the ball touch the opponents'side of the court.</p>
